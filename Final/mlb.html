                <p class="project-paragraph">These are cards I created as concepts for MLB The Show. Each of these 
                    were concepts for the Finest series or the 2020 Draft series. Over the course of my internship, 
                    I made roughly 20 concepts, these are just 7 of them. The largest concept was picked to be the 
                    concept for the 2020 Finest series and expanded upon after I left my internship. It was important 
                    that easch card have the player name, team colors, team logo (clearly shown, not covered), player 
                    position, and card type on the card.</p>

                <p class="project-paragraph">During my time working on MLB The Show, I created a series of menus which players 
                    could use to start games, edit their team, and look at player statistics. Throughout this project, it was 
                    important to me that players got a sense of motion through the menus. This would help players feel like 
                    they were spending less time in menus.</p>
